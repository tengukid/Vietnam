                <p class="p-3">Pho is a Vietnamese soup consisting of bone broth, rice noodles, and thinly sliced meat
                    (usually beef).
                    It may also be served with bean sprouts, fresh herbs, limes, chiles, and other garnishes.

                    The origins of pho are a bit murky, but it is generally believed to have originated in early 20th
                    century northern Vietnam. It eventually migrated south after the division of the country in 1954,
                    and
                    gained even more popularity following the Vietnam War as refugees introduced it to other cultures.
